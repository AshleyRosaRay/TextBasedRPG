RENDERER

SCREEN

- Layers (generically useful, in the editor to be used for tool previews)

CONTROLLER

- break out input handling into its own class paired with the renderer - pass standard events through to the editor
  makes it so that editor doesnt need input handling rewritten with fancier renderers (since canvas rendering eg means no span structure)
  this class is also a good place to fill gaps between mousemove events for clean lines on drag
  - keypress event, click event, mouse move
  - events to pass through coords on the ascii grid

EDITOR
- Fill in mousemove events (no gaps in drawing)
- Brush Modes
 i Class per brush, parent brush

 > Also put text into system clipboard - not strictly necessary but fun
